# CALCULATOR
A calculator is a device or software tool designed for performing mathematical calculations. It can handle a variety of mathematical operations, ranging from basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to more advanced functions such as square roots, exponentiation, and trigonometric calculations.

#Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+): Combining two or more numbers to find their total.
Subtraction (-): Finding the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication (*): Repeated addition, or finding the total of a number added to itself a certain number of times.
Division (/): Sharing or distributing a quantity into a specified number of parts.
#User Interface:

Calculators typically have a user-friendly interface with buttons or keys corresponding to different numerical values and operations. In software calculators, the interface may be graphical or text-based.
